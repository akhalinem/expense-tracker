# ExpenseTracker API V2 - TODO & Future Improvements

## 🚀 High Priority Items

### 1. Database Migration to Prisma ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Replace Supabase client with Prisma ORM
- [x] Set up Prisma schema and migrations
- [x] Update all database queries to use Prisma
- [x] Test data consistency and performance
- [x] Baseline existing database with migration `0001_initial`

**Migration Status:** Prisma successfully integrated with Supabase PostgreSQL

- Dual schema support (`auth`, `public`)
- Connection pooling configured
- Migration system baselined for future schema changes

**Next Steps for Database:**

- Use `npx prisma migrate dev --name "description"` for future schema changes
- Monitor query performance vs Supabase client
- Consider database backup strategy before major migrations

### 2. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add request validation sanitization
- [ ] Set up CORS policies for production
- [ ] Add security headers (helmet.js)
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for internal services

## ⚡ Performance & Build Optimizations

### 3. Bundling & Build Optimization

Currently using standard TypeScript compilation without bundling. Consider implementing one of these bundling solutions for production:

#### **Option A: esbuild (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install --save-dev esbuild esbuild-node-externals
```

**Benefits:**

- Extremely fast build times (10-100x faster than webpack)
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Tree shaking for smaller bundles
- Path alias resolution at build time
- Minimal configuration required

**Configuration Example:**

```javascript
// build.js
const esbuild = require("esbuild");
const { nodeExternalsPlugin } = require("esbuild-node-externals");

esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ["app.ts"],
  bundle: true,
  platform: "node",
  target: "node18",
  outfile: "dist/app.js",
  plugins: [nodeExternalsPlugin()],
  external: ["@supabase/supabase-js"],
  sourcemap: true,
  minify: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
});
```

#### **Option B: webpack**

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-node-externals ts-loader
```

**Benefits:**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugins
- Advanced code splitting capabilities
- Hot module replacement for development
- Comprehensive asset management

**Use Case:** Complex applications with multiple entry points

#### **Option C: Rollup**

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup @rollup/plugin-typescript @rollup/plugin-node-resolve
```

**Benefits:**

- Excellent tree shaking
- Smaller bundle sizes
- ES module focused
- Great for libraries

**Use Case:** When bundle size is critical

#### **Implementation Plan:**

1. **Phase 1:** Set up esbuild for production builds
2. **Phase 2:** Configure path alias resolution in bundler
3. **Phase 3:** Optimize for production (minification, source maps)
4. **Phase 4:** Set up different builds for dev/prod environments

**Expected Improvements:**

- 🚀 50-90% faster build times
- 📦 Smaller production bundles
- 🔄 Resolved absolute imports without runtime overhead
- ⚡ Improved cold start times in production

- ✅ Express.js REST API
- ✅ Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- ✅ Supabase for auth (database queries migrated to Prisma)
- ✅ Relative imports (standard Node.js)
- ✅ Background job processing
- ✅ Validation middleware
- ✅ Migration system baselined

### Target Architecture:

- 🎯 Bundled production builds
- 🎯 Comprehensive testing coverage
- 🎯 Production-ready monitoring
- 🎯 Automated CI/CD pipeline

## 📝 Notes on Bundling Decision

**Why not bundling immediately?**

1. **Simplicity:** Standard Node.js patterns are easier to debug
2. **Dependencies:** Some Node.js packages don't bundle well
3. **Development Speed:** No build step for development iterations
4. **Debugging:** Source maps work better without bundling complexity

**When to implement bundling:**

1. **Production Performance:** When startup time becomes critical
2. **Deployment Size:** When reducing bundle size matters
3. **Complex Dependencies:** When managing many external packages
4. **Team Growth:** When build consistency becomes important

**Recommended Timeline:**

- **After Prisma Migration:** Focus on core functionality first
- **Before Production Launch:** Implement for production optimization
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular optimization and monitoring
