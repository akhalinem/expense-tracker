# ExpenseTracker API V2 - TODO & Future Improvements

## 🚀 High Priority Items

### 1. Database Migration to Prisma

- [ ] Replace Supabase client with Prisma ORM
- [ ] Set up Prisma schema and migrations
- [ ] Update all database queries to use Prisma
- [ ] Test data consistency and performance

### 2. Security Enhancements

- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add request validation sanitization
- [ ] Set up CORS policies for production
- [ ] Add security headers (helmet.js)
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for internal services

## ⚡ Performance & Build Optimizations

### 3. Bundling & Build Optimization

Currently using standard TypeScript compilation without bundling. Consider implementing one of these bundling solutions for production:

#### **Option A: esbuild (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install --save-dev esbuild esbuild-node-externals
```

**Benefits:**

- Extremely fast build times (10-100x faster than webpack)
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Tree shaking for smaller bundles
- Path alias resolution at build time
- Minimal configuration required

**Configuration Example:**

```javascript
// build.js
const esbuild = require("esbuild");
const { nodeExternalsPlugin } = require("esbuild-node-externals");

esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ["app.ts"],
  bundle: true,
  platform: "node",
  target: "node18",
  outfile: "dist/app.js",
  plugins: [nodeExternalsPlugin()],
  external: ["@supabase/supabase-js"],
  sourcemap: true,
  minify: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
});
```

#### **Option B: webpack**

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-node-externals ts-loader
```

**Benefits:**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugins
- Advanced code splitting capabilities
- Hot module replacement for development
- Comprehensive asset management

**Use Case:** Complex applications with multiple entry points

#### **Option C: Rollup**

```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup @rollup/plugin-typescript @rollup/plugin-node-resolve
```

**Benefits:**

- Excellent tree shaking
- Smaller bundle sizes
- ES module focused
- Great for libraries

**Use Case:** When bundle size is critical

#### **Implementation Plan:**

1. **Phase 1:** Set up esbuild for production builds
2. **Phase 2:** Configure path alias resolution in bundler
3. **Phase 3:** Optimize for production (minification, source maps)
4. **Phase 4:** Set up different builds for dev/prod environments

**Expected Improvements:**

- 🚀 50-90% faster build times
- 📦 Smaller production bundles
- 🔄 Resolved absolute imports without runtime overhead
- ⚡ Improved cold start times in production

### 4. Development Experience

- [ ] Set up Docker containerization
- [ ] Add environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Implement structured logging (winston/pino)
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints
- [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Unit tests with Jest
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Database testing with test containers
- [ ] End-to-end testing setup
- [ ] Code coverage reporting

### 6. Code Quality

- [ ] ESLint configuration with TypeScript rules
- [ ] Prettier code formatting
- [ ] Husky pre-commit hooks
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] SonarQube code analysis

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### 7. Production Monitoring

- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- [ ] Health checks and uptime monitoring
- [ ] Log aggregation (ELK stack)

### 8. Database Monitoring

- [ ] Query performance monitoring
- [ ] Connection pool monitoring
- [ ] Slow query detection
- [ ] Database backup automation

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Deployment

### 9. Deployment Strategy

- [ ] Multi-environment setup (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Blue-green deployment
- [ ] Database migration strategies
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration

### 10. Scalability Considerations

- [ ] Horizontal scaling setup
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] Caching strategy (Redis)
- [ ] Background job queue (Bull/Agenda)
- [ ] API versioning strategy

## 📚 Documentation

### 11. Technical Documentation

- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Deployment guides
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Performance tuning guides

## 🔄 Migration Tasks

### 12. Gradual Improvements

- [ ] Migrate from CommonJS to ESM modules
- [ ] Implement GraphQL endpoints alongside REST
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time features
- [ ] Implement event-driven architecture
- [ ] Add multi-tenant support

## 📋 Current Architecture Notes

### Current State:

- ✅ TypeScript with strict type checking
- ✅ Express.js REST API
- ✅ Supabase for database and auth
- ✅ Relative imports (standard Node.js)
- ✅ Background job processing
- ✅ Validation middleware

### Target Architecture:

- 🎯 Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- 🎯 Bundled production builds
- 🎯 Comprehensive testing coverage
- 🎯 Production-ready monitoring
- 🎯 Automated CI/CD pipeline

## 📝 Notes on Bundling Decision

**Why not bundling immediately?**

1. **Simplicity:** Standard Node.js patterns are easier to debug
2. **Dependencies:** Some Node.js packages don't bundle well
3. **Development Speed:** No build step for development iterations
4. **Debugging:** Source maps work better without bundling complexity

**When to implement bundling:**

1. **Production Performance:** When startup time becomes critical
2. **Deployment Size:** When reducing bundle size matters
3. **Complex Dependencies:** When managing many external packages
4. **Team Growth:** When build consistency becomes important

**Recommended Timeline:**

- **After Prisma Migration:** Focus on core functionality first
- **Before Production Launch:** Implement for production optimization
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular optimization and monitoring
